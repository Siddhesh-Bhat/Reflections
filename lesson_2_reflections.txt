1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-> When you initialize a repository, git creates metadata about the repository which helps in keeping track of changes made to it. If we dont initialize it, then it will be just a regular directory without any version history.


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
-> Staging area is an intermediate area where the files are tracked but not yet committed. The working directory has files which are untracked and uncommitted while the repository has all the committed files. Due to staging area we can add specific files to a commit which we think are logically related.


3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-> Instead of directly committing all the files, you can add the first logically related files to the staging area and then commit them, then add the next set of logically related files to the staging area and issue an commit and so on. 


4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?


5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?


6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?


7. What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
